The Moroccan web scene has made a huge step forward to becoming more mature. With the launch of many big and medium web projects and the IT startup philosophy starting to get hold in the country, the demand for talented web developers up to the challenge is higher than ever.

Such progress needs people to maintain it, push it even further, and keep it on the right path through open debates, meet-ups and conferences, promoting new technologies, modern tools and best practices.

However the Moroccan web community is far behind in its mission.

Thus, we, a bunch of Moroccans who care about PHP and what we build with it, decided to create the Moroccan PHP Artisans user group. With our motto: fellowship and contribution, we seek to bring developers together to share knowledge and help the Moroccan web community grow stronger.

PHP is our primary focus, but we are in no way restricted to it. You can think of us as a user group of web based technologies. However, as we are just starting and each one of us, your fellow organizers, is doing this for the first time, we chose to focus on one PHP framework for the time being. And we picked [Laravel](http://laravel.com). Its [potential](http://www.sitepoint.com/best-php-frameworks-2014/), its awesome community and its growing ecosystem, made it our first choice.

If you're a developer and you're interested in learning or networking or sharing knowledge, please get in touch! We offer the opportunity to meet other passionate developers, exchange ideas and talk code and innovation.
